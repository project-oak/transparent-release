# Fuzzing Claims for revisions of a source code

## Generating fuzzing claims using the `cmd/fuzzbinder` tool

### Establish access to GCS

To get the fuzzing statistics, you should have access to the fuzzing metadata generated by OSS-Fuzz and ClusterFuzz for your project. Set up `gsutil` and ensure that you have access to the fuzzing metadata by doing the following:
- Install the [gsutil tool](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install).
- Check whether you have access to the fuzzing logs and coverage reports of your project:
```sh
$ gsutil ls gs://oss-fuzz-coverage/${PROJECT_NAME}
```
```sh
$ gsutil ls gs://${PROJECT_NAME}-logs.clusterfuzz-external.appspot.com
```
If you get an authorization error from the commands above, run the following commands:
```sh
$ gcloud auth application-default login
```
```sh
$ gcloud auth login
```
If you still have problems authentication problems look at this [Authentication Guide](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html) and try again. Once `gsutil` works, you can run the fuzzing claim generation.

### Generate fuzzing claim 
The [`fuzzbinder`](/internal/fuzzbinder/) package provides functionality for generating a fuzzing claim file. 

To generate a fuzzing claim run:

```sh
$ go run cmd/fuzzbinder/main.go -project_name <project-name> -homepage <path-to-project-git-repo-root> -fuzzengine <fuzzing-engine> -sanitizer <fuzzing-sanitizer> -date <fuzzing-date> -fuzzclaim_path <fuzzclaim-path>
```
