The `rekor_entry.json` file was generated by doing the following

keys were made by calling:
`openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 > oak_ec_private.pem`
`openssl ec -in oak_ec_private.pem -pubout > oak_ec_public.pem`

the signature was generated with:
`openssl dgst -sha256 -sign oak_ec_private.pem -out endorsement_file.json.sig endorsement_file.json`

the endorsement file was uploaded with:
`rekor-cli upload --artifact endorsement_file.json --signature endorsement_file.json.sig --pki-format=x509 --public-key=oak_ec_public.pem`

the output of this is:
`Created entry at index 2236024, available at: https://rekor.sigstore.dev/api/v1/log/entries/286cbb66e1534a189a27adca9b78f5d27989e89c74a3bea11c2c741657e159e1`
